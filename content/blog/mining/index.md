# The Mining Situation

While aware of Bitcoin for years, I didn't take enough notice of cryptocurrency until I learned about smart contracts and Ethereum in 2017. Deeply impressed that I'd glimpsed a scrap of the future, I sold old collectibles and other memorabilia to buy Ether, then ultimately decided to build a mining computer in order to generate the crypto myself.

Although I built this rig to mine Ethereum, it's currently best to use it for RavenCoin. Mining RavenCoin is not difficult to set up, and it's possible on gaming PCs because it's a democratic blockchain that doesn't work any better in big mines!

A crypto mining rig runs 24/7 and can help warm your apartment if it's in the right spot. Ancient steam radiators disperse heat passively, I'm lucky to enjoy this great synergy of old and new tech!

The mine sends its production directly to my blockchain wallet (Trust Wallet). I receive 50 RVN each batch, which is about US$5 at time of writing. These GPUs are pretty well optimized to run quietly and cheaply while still mining well-- I did this using the vendor's own drivers, modifying settings manually.
