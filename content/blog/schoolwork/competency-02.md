> “Describe and compare the organizational settings in which library and information professionals practice”



# Introduction



Library and information professionals currently practice in similar organizational settings. In both public libraries run by government agencies and academic libraries found in universities and colleges, they fulfill comparable roles. Such is the case too in private and public school libraries, from elementary into junior high and high school, and in special libraries, such as law libraries found in private firms. Some information professionals work in companies in a digital services capacity or work in archives. Then there are more freelance careers, traditionally open to information professionals who are catalogers, indexers, abstract writers and other specialties which work on an ad hoc basis or from a distance. Each of these settings utilizes library and information professionals when managing the organization and distribution of information; each of these settings have their own pros and cons for LIS professionals.



Public libraries often suffer a cut in hours or days of operation based on budgetary concerns. Public library managers are required to track spending, per service usage rates, and other business data in order to craft detailed budgets, request funding, and apply for grants. Finances may need to be tightly monitored at public libraries as they are often under-funded due to their governmental status. This also guarantees that public librarians and information professionals have less flexibility when it comes to controlling policy. Any incidents with patrons must be dealt with according to precise directives, i.e., summarizing the event in a certain format for organization-wide distribution. Additionally, they create customized and free instructional programs, usually tailored to the demographics of their patrons, as public libraries continue to provide immediate and approachable information access for all members of society. Public librarians and information professionals provide day to day assistance to patrons, yet they also function as front-line protectors and promoters of intellectual freedom and free speech.



The term academic library usually refers to a university or college library department. This may include information professionals working on not just library patron services, but on other projects such as digitization, research, or collection management. Some academic libraries provide world-class support to their institutions’ research projects and earn the title of research library, as bestowed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education and other regulatory bodies. Yet even the biggest academic libraries still contend with budgetary issues as well as the politics of academia. Librarians in research or academic libraries may have to reach tenure in order to be promoted to a management position: some are required to publish research in this quest. These LIS professionals coordinate with professors and provide necessary documents to student patrons. They assist students with their assignments and research, and they support academic IT needs. During critical times such as midterms and finals they will often keep their library open for extended hours to provide a study area for students.



The librarians at school (from kindergarten up through high school) libraries are sometimes the only information professionals in their organization. In small schools it is not uncommon for the library to be run by just one person. It is therefore essential that they advocate for their library in school meetings. As managers of their own department, they decide what practices and protocols to follow, yet the young age of their customers requires them to keep up to date with new technologies– perhaps here more than in any other LIS organizational role. They too have budgetary concerns and often have to be extremely creative in stretching their funds as educators and managers, and they too collect usage data for their services and programs. They are responsible for the successful marketing of their library and the creation and implementation of programs for their student patrons.



Special libraries are often privately owned, such as a law library in a large law firm. This unusual arrangement means that budgetary concerns are less pressing. However, the policies and practices may be altered at a whim. Much as LIS professionals in other settings record data on how their libraries are used, those in special libraries must do the same. This allows them to defend the need for certain services to their supervisors, and sometimes even expand upon these services. Due to their exclusive nature, special libraries are able to focus directly on their patrons’ needs; a law librarian can focus the entirety of his or her collection on the particular type of law being practiced at the firm. Despite the comparative freedom this type of organization allows, information professionals tasked to manage a special library may have few or no supporting employees, making it a challenge to keep abreast of technological and industry standards.



Freelance information professionals usually work in digital environments. They perform piecemeal work for pay, unlike salaried LIS professionals, so to ensure regular work they frequently maintain continuing professional relationships with client organizations and firms. While some freelancers operate directly with their employers, some never interact face to face but communicate and work virtually. Commonly this group of information professionals includes abstractors, indexers, and catalogers who are sent a book or other document to process. Like most freelancers, they are more concerned with their next assignment than with their current management or budget. They may experience dry spells without much work, and must carefully oversee their own expenses as a result. They are keenly motivated to keep abreast of technology in their field as independent contractors.



# Evidence



My first piece of evidence is LIBR 200 Assignment #2. This paper investigates the Association of Research Libraries (the ARL), focusing on the Association itself as well as the benefits and opportunities of membership and how research libraries may apply for it. I learned a great deal about research libraries and the rigorous application requirements for acceptance into the ARL through this Assignment. Unlike most academic holdings, research libraries have ratable aspects such as the quality of their collection and services, requiring their parent institution’s aspirations and achievements earn a High or Very High rating with the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning or similar bodies.



My second piece of evidence is LIBR 200 Assignment #3. In this paper I explored the idea of working at the small community library where I once lived, in a small city in California. Beyond searching my own fond memories of the place, I examined job postings so as to estimate what it would be like to work at this public library in semi-rural Butte County, becoming familiar with the requirements, yearly salary, and the many benefits available to employees. As a result, I was able to discuss the numerous job duties that I would be expected to fulfill in this particular organization. As I researched their history and mission, I began to realize the many benefits a library brings to their user base and found evidence that an effective public library is an important key to revitalizing a downtown area. Both an economic and cultural force, they are an important part of the community they serve.



My third piece of evidence is an environmental scan from a LIBR 204 project in which my group and I were tasked with finding an information organization to analyze. Over several weeks we examined a small school library, Xxxx School Library, which employed one of our group members as its sole LIS professional. We split up the assignments among our four-person team, with the Xxxx School Librarian and I collaborating directly, analyzing different elements affecting the library, as well as its place in the parent organizational structure. This assignment therefore provided me excellent insight into the details and workings of this type of library. We also conducted a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis, which further illuminated aspects of running a public school library.



# Conclusion



The organizations that employ LIS professionals are varied, but occupational duties remain quite constant overall. Similar requirements across many library types include: keeping track of collection service use and costs; maximizing collection efficiency and access; defending budget requests. Depending upon the organization, LIS professionals may function within large departments or may be allowed to work independently. They may be surrounded with like-minded professionals, or they may be alone in defending their department against budget cuts. Some receive more freedom in decision making, such as those in freelance or special libraries. As a hallmark of our profession each librarian and information professional, no matter their role or the organization in which they serve, strives to make the information in their charge both easy to use and relevant for their patrons.
