> “Recognize and describe cultural and economic diversity in the clientele of libraries or information organizations”



# Introduction



Every community is composed of many different types of people. The area of Seattle, Washington where I grew up has several different cultural and socioeconomic groups. As early as elementary school I was aware that many people were English as a Second Language speakers. This included Spanish as a First Language speakers as well as several different Asian language populations. Also worth noting is that not everyone of Spanish or Asian descent fits this description- some spoke English as their primary or only language. I found learning about the cultures of my classmates to be very helpful to my growth as a human being.



I eventually learned that not all of my classmates shared the same economic situation as me. Some lived in much larger, multi-floor houses in other neighborhoods than mine. Some lived in apartments or government housing. Some had stay-at-home parents who spent a great deal of time and effort on their kids’ bagged lunches. Others had meal plans and got free breakfasts and lunches through the school.



Early on I decided that people must exist on a spectrum. I feel that it is important not to let those differences between us prevent librarians and information professionals from providing equal access and assistance to everyone. In fact, acknowledgment of the differences between cultures, languages, and economic statuses can have a highly positive effect on library services, by uniquely tailoring their collections to reflect the languages and interests of their communities.



For example, in my volunteering experience at a local public library I had the opportunity to assist in the sorting of reserved holds. This particular branch of the local public library system services a very culturally diverse area that is quite similar to my hometown in outer Seattle, with a number of Asian population groups and many Vietnamese- and Spanish-speaking patrons. The library’s book, DVD, and music collection reflect this diversity, which reminded me strongly of my own high school library, where I volunteered as a library aide my senior year.



I was delighted to see that this library’s hold system (unlike my high school’s) was so popular with its diverse assortment of patrons. At this library they make an effort, from the children’s section to the computer labs and language clubs, to include their Vietnamese- and Spanish-speaking patrons. From firsthand experience sorting and shelving holds at this branch, I can vouch for the large number of non-English items accessed from their collections. One service I was aware of was a Spanish computer lab time slot as well as homework hours and children’s story time. This directly proves that these patrons utilize their library and its services to a great degree. Again, I think this is mainly due to the efforts of the librarians to include their patrons’ cultural needs in the library’s mission, services, policies and collections.



This example is one that I personally plan to emulate in my career as an information professional. A good library should take into account the diverse needs of its patrons, and even a small branch can and must do this to make their patrons feel comfortable, appreciated, and served.



# Evidence



My first piece of evidence is an annotated bibliography from LIBR 271A. This version of the class was focused on Graphic Novels. The assignment is an annotated bibliography of Science-fiction graphic novels for adults. I wanted a variety of ten different works with different authors, with three of them manga (Japanese graphic novels), which I felt was important to include. I also wanted to make sure I created a list of geographically diverse authors, so as to appeal to a greater audience. This annotated bibliography included the citation, my personal review of the work, and two professional reviews.



My second piece of evidence is a quick write assignment from LIBR 268 called Bookstore Inventory. This paper asked us to examine the inventory of a local library or bookstore’s children’s section. I examined book covers to see what sort of information I could get about the book from the author(s) name and the characters on the book. I also looked at the language the book was written in. I examined the books found on displays in the children’s section of Gregory Heights library, where I was volunteering. Of the 88 books, I found that roughly 25% were multicultural. The books included African-American, Spanish and Asian casts on the cover, or was written in non-English languages. I concluded that the diverse cultural needs of the library patrons were well represented.



My third piece of evidence is a quick write from LIBR 268 called Teenagers in the Mist. This paper required me to interview a teenager about her reading habits. I encountered a teenage girl on the street and interviewed her. She discussed her usual reading habits, the last book she read for fun, the last book she read for school, her favorite book series, the contents of her home book collection, and which library she borrowed book from. She also discussed how she chose new reading material. I found this to be a wonderful view into the reading habits of an age group and culture I’m no longer a part of.



# Conclusion



It’s extremely important to make sure that all of the patrons, not just the majority, are represented in the collection, and services of a library. Representation in media of people who look and speak like you and your family is a way for patrons of all ages to feel that they have a place in the library, and larger community. When time is taken to make an effort to understand the diverse needs of the library patrons, this increased the library’s usefulness to the people they serve, and the community in general. Everyone deserves the opportunity to be represented in their community. Everyone should have the right to go to their local library and find something for themselves to enjoy.
