> “Describe the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors”



# Introduction



Information seeking behaviors describes how people search for and utilize information. Conceptually, theories of information seeking behavior (ISB) are broken into steps or stages of actions that lead to successfully accessing the desired resources. These range from targeted queries to those who just browse for something that fulfills criteria. All of these are strategies of ISB that are commonly used.



A search-directed ISB is typically very focused. The user knows exactly what they want and they prefer to navigate to that information rapidly. They will focus on the most direct path, be that Googling from a library computer, using the library’s OPAC to find the item’s physical location in the stacks, or asking a research librarian directly. They usually possess some information about the resource they want, such as bibliographic or topic. Yet sometimes talented librarians are asked to find a book based on very slight details like cover art, a character name, or a plot synopsis.



Browsing is a more indirect ISB than searching. This behavior encompasses users who are looking around (physically, virtually, or both) and exploring services based upon broader interests or less-precise search requirements. Browsers usually have a general criteria of what they’re looking for, and with physical information resources they may be seen walking the stacks of a particular subject, such as mysteries or science fiction, in order to visually inspect it. They may not be able to say exactly what they are looking for, but they “will know it when they find it”. For digital information resources, they may do keyword searches which seem vague and open-ended compared to a true search-directed ISB, to simply see what’s available and help them narrow their hunt.



The skill levels of a library user can have a large impact on their ISB, so it’s worthwhile discussing the difference in proficiency levels of searchers and browsers when using information retrieval systems (IR) . A less IR-savvy library user in a searching mode would likely go straight to a librarian to gain assistance in finding the information they want. Conversely, a high-level IR user would likely feel comfortable going straight to the nearest open computer and searching using the Internet or OPAC system, and may even wish to locate their resources independently of any librarian’s assistance.



Of course with browsing ISBs, the user’s prior IR experience matters a bit less. For example, a low-level computer and perhaps first-time library patron performing a browsing ISB would likely act similarly to a high-level IR user when looking for physical resources: they might both browse the stacks, wandering around and reading the library labels until the ISB narrowed and changed into search-directed, or until the browsing requirements were met.



Naturally, LIS services can be created and tailored to these two different ISBs. Browsing users can benefit from having well labeled and organized sections of the library, to ease and speed their search. They may also appreciate guides or building maps highlighting specific subject matter. Well-labeled computers for both OPAC-specific and general Internet and other applications will prove useful for browsing users who don’t wish to navigate physical holdings.



Users who conduct specific, search-directed ISBs tend will appreciate having the same computer set up to allow for both Internet and OPAC system queries. Advanced searchers, or users wishing to improve their search-directed skills, may appreciate special workshops that provide training on new technologies and LIS practices– these are offered at many modern libraries, public and private. Patrons of all ISBs, ages and abilities will always appreciate having knowledgeable, friendly staff to assist them in finding the information they desire.



# Evidence



My first piece of evidence is Assignment #1 from LIBR 202. In this assignment, I was tasked with examining three IR systems and evaluating how well a term was retrieved, from the view point of an everyday user. The search term was “History of the Olympics”. The first system evaluated was Google’s basic web search, which I found to be low on precision and high in recall, with a large number of records. The second system was the SJSU King Library search which gave many useful articles on the subject though their database search. The third system was a local public library, which had very few useful resources in the physical location, with the few there being children’s books. Overall, the King Library was found to provide the greatest number of usable resources.



My second piece of evidence is Assignment #3 from LIBR 202. This assignment tasked me to create a simple data structure with a table of attributes, rules for each attribute, and values for an assigned image collection created with a particular user group in mind. The user group was students taking an architecture appreciation course. The table of attributes with rules was created by drawing from the users’ self-reported ISBs. Part of this assignment involved a group collaboration to generate terms used for the image collection, but the paper was an individual effort.



My third piece of evidence is Assignment #5 from LIBR 202. This assignment tasked me with evaluating and comparing two databases -JSTOR and Project MUSE- and creating and conducting user tests of both. After discussing the user groups’ anticipated needs, I described the databases’ licencing details and content selection processes, then examined their search processes. The users were all students from diverse educational backgrounds and their ISB reflected this.



# Conclusion



The two main strategies for information seeking behaviors (ISB) are searching and browsing. Searchers know exactly what they want or have only a scrap of information to go on, yet they want to find that precise resource. They will utilize OPAC systems, general Internet searches, and question librarians. Browsing users are more generalized in their information desires; sometimes they want to walk around see what sort of Westerns or biographies are available on the shelf. Browsers will use signage in the library to navigate the physical space as they browse, and will browse online to see what they can find, using a less targeted approach than searchers. As LIS professionals, our goal is to build upon established ISBs in order to empower the searcher to succeed, especially with little to no outside assistance.
