# Digital Services

The Information School’s SLIS graduate program allows its students to focus on the style of librarianship that most appeals to them. Because of my fondness for technology, I chose to focus on Digital Services.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve had the good fortune to work with the Digital Services department at Portland State University’s Millar Library, gaining experience with various projects while ingesting physical records into a permanent, searchable archive.

The evidence of my classwork and interests are visible here, with this website. I will continue to add to this as my career develops.

# E-Portfolio

The culmination of my LIS graduate work was the creation of my e-portfolio. This e-portfolio organized my two and half years of school work into several pages, based on topic. Each page includes a description of the competency, an essay on the topic, and three pieces of evidence of my work. I recently reread my essays, to redact any information and generally reminisce. I’ve added links to their pages below.
