The culmination of my LIS graduate work was the creation of my e-portfolio. This e-portfolio organized my two and half years of school work into several pages, based on topic. Each page includes a description of the competency, an essay on the topic, and three pieces of evidence of my work. I recently reread my essays, to redact any information and generally reminisce. Iâ€™ve added links to their pages below.
