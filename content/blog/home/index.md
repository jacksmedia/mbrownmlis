# Greetings and Salutation!

I'm Emily Brown, data analyst, digital librarian and proud Pacific Northwesterner. This is my website, where you can learn more about me, and the work I accomplished for my degree. My e-portfolio, SJSU's MLIS version of a thesis, is broken down into many parts. Enjoy exploring the site!
